**Colors** are widely used in CSS, whether for text color, background color, gradients, shadows, borders... There are several ways to define colors in CSS, each with their own pros and cons.

The `color` property defines the color of the **text**. It is pretty straightforward. What is more important is the different types of **color units** available.

### Color names

CSS provides [145 colors names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value), from the most basic (black, white, orange, yellow, blue...) to the more specific (lawngreen, orchid, crimson...).

{% highlight css %}
body{ color: black;}
a{ color: orange;}
{% endhighlight %}

Because the color names are hard to remember, and because you probably want very specific colors, color names are not often used.

### rgb

Computer monitors, TVs, mobile phones, all use the RGB color model to display colors. Basically, each color is defined by a combination of Red, Green, and Blue. There are 256 possible values for Red, Green or Blue. Because computers start counting at 0 (zero), the maximum value is 255.

Considering a color is the result of a _combination_ of Red, Green and Blue, and because each of these 3 colors have 256 possible values, there are `256 * 256 * 256 = 16,777,216` possible colors available.

Because the RGB model is directly related to how colors are _physically_ rendered, it has become a CSS color unit.

For example, the red color of this website is 219 amounts of Red, 78 of Green, and 68 of Blue:

{% highlight css %}
a{ color: rgb(219, 78, 68);}
{% endhighlight %}

The black color is no amount of either Red, Green or Blue:

{% highlight css %}
body{ color: rgb(0, 0, 0);}
{% endhighlight %}

On the other side of the spectrum, white is the full amount of each Red, Green and Blue:

{% highlight css %}
body{ color: rgb(255, 255, 255);}
{% endhighlight %}

### rgba

The `rgba` color unit is `rgb` to which we add an **alpha** value (ranging from 0 to 1, in decimal values), which defines how transparent the color is:

{% highlight css %}
body{ color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);}
{% endhighlight %}

A slightly transparent black color.

The purpose of a color being transparent is to blend with the background, and consequently look slightly different depending on the context. It is particularly useful for **background colors**.

### hsl and hsla

**HSL** is another way to define a color. Think of it as a **color wheel**.

![Image](#)

Instead of a color being a combination of Red, Green and Blue, you define:

* the **Hue** a value ranging from 0 to 360, defines _which color_ you want.
* the **Saturation** percentage, ranging from 0% to 100%, defines _how much_ of that color you want.
* the **Lightness** percentage, ranging from 0% to 100%, defines _how bright_ you want that color to be.

Again, the red color of this website is defined this way in HSL:

{% highlight css %}
a{ color: hsl(4, 68%, 56%);}
{% endhighlight %}

`4` indicates it's red
`68%` indicates the red is quite prominent
`56%` indicates it's halfway between black and white

The `hsl` color unit is easier to understand than `rgb` because the expected result is clearer. You basically define a color in 3 separate steps, and can play around with each value to come up with the color you want. If you want a yellow shade, you can start with a value like `hsl(50, 68%, 56%)`, and alter the Saturation and Lightness value to find the specific shade you're looking for.

I consider `hsl` to be **human-readable**, whereas `rgb` is more **computer-readable**.

`hsla` is the same as `hsl`, with the added value of being able to define an **alpha** value:

{% highlight css %}
body{ color: hsla(4, 68%, 56%, 0.5);}
{% endhighlight %}

A transparent red color.

### Hexadecimal

Colors in CSS can also be defined with **hexadecimal values**, like `#db4e44`.

To understand what hexadecimal values are, let's look at how binary and decimal work:

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>
        binary
        <em>2 possible values</em>
      </th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>
        decimal
        <em>10 possible values</em>
      </th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>
        hexadecimal
        <em>16 possible values</em>
      </th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>E</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Consider the 0-9 numbers and the A-F letters as **symbols**.

Humans use the **decimal** system. We have 10 symbols to form numbers.

In **hexadecimal**, we have 16 symbols to form numbers. Because 0-9 are not enough symbols, we also use A-F. And it starts at zero. So:

* the number `4` in hexadecimal is `4`
* the number `12` in hexadecimal is `C`
* the number `16` in hexadecimal is `10` because after you've run out of symbols (the last one being `F`), you add a second symbol to the left and increment (`0` becomes `1`) and the right one starts over (from `F` to `0`)

#### Do I have to remember this?

Not at all! It is here to provide an explanation of how hexadecimal values work. The most important thing to remember is that there are 16 hexadecimal symbols.

Just like RGB, a hexadecimal color value is a combination of Red, Green, and Blue, each of them being represent as a hexadecimal value, like `DB` for Red, `4E` for Green, and `44` for Blue.

Because Red, Green or Blue can only have 2 symbols, their possible values are `16 * 16 = 256`, which mirrors the RGB color unit!

#### Why not use RGB then?

Usually, when choosing colors, you **don't write** them directly. You either use a color picker, or copy/paste it from Photoshop, or choose a [colour palette](http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes) somewhere.

Hexadecimal values are easier to **copy and paste**, as they only comprise 6 characters.

![Photoshop one field for hex](/images/photoshop-color-picker.png)

#### It is easier to copy paste a single field than 3 separate ones.

In CSS, you only need to prepend a hexadecimal color value with a hash `#`.

### Which one to pick?

If you don't intend to use any transparent color, stick to **hexadecimal** values, as they are easier to copy/paste and don't take much space in your code.

If you want some transparency, convert your color from hex to rgba, and use the `rgba` color unit.

If you want to play around with your color directly in the browser, try `hsl`.
