### Show file extensions

Let's say you have a solar eclipse picture on your computer, it will show up as:

![Solar Eclipse](/images/solar-eclipse.jpg)

* the **name** of the file is `solar-eclipse`
* the **extension** of the file is `.jpg`

A file's extension defines the _type_ of file it is (in this case, an image). For HTML files, the extension is `.html`.

By default, **file extensions** are hidden. In this tutorial, we'll need to be able to edit these extensions. So follow these instructions to display file extensions:

* **Windows**: [Show or hide file name extensions](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hide-file-name-extensions)
* **Mac**: [Show and hide filename extensions](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH10845?locale=en_US)

### Download a good Web browser
