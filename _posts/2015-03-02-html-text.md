When your write HTML code, you write **text**. But what is usually displayed in the browser is also **text**.

Although images, videos, and music have grown in popularity, websites still mostly comprise text content, such as this particular paragraph you are currently reading.

### Paragraphs

**Paragraphs** `<p>` are the most used HTML element, as they act as the **default** block-level element and are quick to write.

{% highlight html %}
<p>
  Rank grass, waist high, grows upon the plain of Phutra—the gorgeous flowering grass of the inner world, each particular blade of which is tipped with a tiny, five-pointed blossom—brilliant little stars of varying colors that twinkle in the green foliage to add still another charm to the weird, yet lovely, landscape.
</p>
{% endhighlight %}

### Lists

**Lists** come in 3 variations:

* `<ul>` are unordered lists
* `<ol>` are ordered lists (whose items are automatically numbered)
* `<dl>` are definition lists

HTML lists require a specific structure:

* `<ul>` and `<ol>` must include and be direct **parents** of `<li>` which stands for **list items**.
* consequently, `<li>` elements can not be used on their own, and must be direct **children** of either a `<ul>` or a `<ol>`.

#### Unordered lists

They are the most commonly used types of lists. They are meant to group together a list of indiviudal **items**, in no particular order.

{% highlight html %}
<p>My shopping list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
  <li>Chocolate</li>
  <li>More chocolate</li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

List items are displayed with **bullet points**.

<div class="result">
  <p>My shopping list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Bread</li>
    <li>Chocolate</li>
    <li>More chocolate</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Ordered lists

Ordered lists are used when the **order** of its items is **relevant**.

{% highlight html %}
<ol>
  <li>Step one</li>
  <li>Step two</li>
  <li>????</li>
  <li>PROFIT!!!</li>
</ol>
{% endhighlight %}

Ordered lists are **automatically** numbered by the browser. You don't need to include the numbers in your HTML.

#### Definition lists

Definition lists are for items that come in **pairs**. They must include pairs of `<dt>` definition terms and `<dd>` definition descriptions as direct children.

{% highlight html %}
<dl>
  <dt>Web</dt>
  <dd>The part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages</dd>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>A markup language for creating webpages</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>A technology to make HTML look better</dd>
</dl>
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="result">
  <dl>
    <dt>Web</dt>
    <dd>The part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages</dd>
    <dt>HTML</dt>
    <dd>A markup language for creating webpages</dd>
    <dt>CSS</dt>
    <dd>A technology to make HTML look better</dd>
  </dl>
</div>

Definition lists are rarely used because their use cases are very specific, and only happen when the key changes every time. Tables with 2 columns are the more popular alternative.

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to identify a **citation**.

{% highlight html %}
<p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee said:</p>
<blockquote>
  “The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information.”
</blockquote>
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="result">
  <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information.”
  </blockquote>
</div>

### Headings

There are 6 levels of headings available, ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, 1 being the most important one.

Headings are meant to be used along with paragraphs and lists, to draw a natural structure to your document. As headings carry more semantic weight, be careful to keep the balance between important and "normal" content.

Only using headings in a HTML document wouldn't make sense: if everything feels important, nothing really is. You need to provide depth in your structure.
