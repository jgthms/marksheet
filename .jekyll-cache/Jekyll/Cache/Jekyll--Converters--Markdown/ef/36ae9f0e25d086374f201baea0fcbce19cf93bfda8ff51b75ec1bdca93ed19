I"ð<p>Behind the word <code class="highlighter-rouge">float</code>, an endless sea of possibilities (and misbehaviors).</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">float</code> is probably the most difficult CSS concept to grasp. Its behavior can be intriguing, unexpected, and magical. Probably because, of all <em>positioning</em> properties there are, it is the one that most <em>influences</em> its <strong>surroundings</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, applying a float not only modifies the element itâ€™s applied upon <strong>but also alters its ancestors, siblings, descendants, and following elements</strong>.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">float</code> can only have one of these 3 values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">left</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">right</code> turns an element into a <strong>floating</strong> one</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">none</code> removes the floating aspect</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-to-use-float">When to use float</h3>

<p>The purpose of <strong>floating</strong> an element is to <strong>push it to one side</strong> and make the text <strong>wrap around it</strong>.</p>

<p>To explain the behaviour, letâ€™s use a common example: floating an image within a paragraph.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://placehold.it/150x150"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water trough up the street.  Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm.
<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<div class="result">
  <p style="background: gold; padding: 10px; width: 600px;">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/150x150" />
    It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the Martians had resumed the offensive. So far as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green smoke.
  </p>
</div>

<p>The problem when inserting an image within a text is that <strong>an image must fit on a single line of text</strong>, and will therefore <em>extend</em> the height of the line itâ€™s on. In our case, our image is 150px high.</p>

<p>What we want is to wrap the text <em>around</em> the image:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">img</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="nl">float</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">left</span><span class="p">;}</span></code></pre></figure>

<div class="result">
  <p style="background: gold; padding: 10px; width: 600px;">
    <img style="float: left;" src="http://placehold.it/150x150" />
    It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the Martians had resumed the offensive. So far as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green smoke.
  </p>
</div>

<p>As you can see, the image is <strong>pushed to the left</strong>, and the text that follows just wraps around the image:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first, the text is pushed to the right, <em>next</em> to the image</li>
  <li>then, when thereâ€™s space available <em>below</em> the image, the text will fill that space</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-if-the-text-isnt-long-enough">What if the text isnâ€™t long enough?</h4>

<div class="result">
  <p style="background: gold; padding: 10px; width: 600px;">
    <img style="float: left;" src="http://placehold.it/150x150" />
    He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down stairs behind him
  </p>
</div>

<p>The floating image will <strong>overflow</strong> because itâ€™s higher than its yellow container. And as you can <em>actually</em> see, it even visually breaks <strong>this paragraph youâ€™re reading</strong>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve intentionally left this layout error to showcase <em>why</em> floats are unpredictable: they can even break their parentâ€™s siblings!</p>

<p>Because <code class="highlighter-rouge">float: left</code> takes the image <em>out of</em> the flow, the yellow paragraphâ€™s height is only <strong>the height of its text</strong>. In other words, the height of the image <em>isnâ€™t taken into account</em>.</p>

<h3 id="float--block">Float = block</h3>

<p>Floating elements will have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">display: block</code> applied to them automatically, and will mostly behave like blocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can set a specific height and width</li>
  <li>if no height is set, the elementâ€™s height is that of the line-height</li>
  <li>if a <code class="highlighter-rouge">width: 100%</code> is applied, it will look like a block-level element</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clearing-the-float">Clearing the float</h3>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">clear</code> property allows to <strong>push elements <em>after</em> the float</strong>. It can only be applied on <strong>block</strong> elements.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://placehold.it/150x150"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down stairs behind him<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">img</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="nl">float</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">left</span><span class="p">;}</span>
<span class="nt">span</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="nl">clear</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">left</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nl">display</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">block</span><span class="p">;}</span></code></pre></figure>

<div class="result">
  <p style="background: gold; padding: 10px; width: 600px;">
    <img style="float: left;" src="http://placehold.it/150x150" />
    <span style="clear: left; display: block;">He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down stairs behind him</span>
  </p>
</div>

<p>Instead of having the text pushed <em>next</em> to the image, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">clear: left</code> pushes the text <strong>below</strong> the image.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s different from having no float or clear at all, as the image is on its own line and <em>not</em> on the same line as the text.</p>
